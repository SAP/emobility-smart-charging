## Analyze Issues
Analyzing issue reports can be a lot of effort. Any help is welcome!
Go to [the Github issue tracker](https://github.com/SAP/emobility-smart-charging/issues?state=open) and find an open issue which needs additional work or a bugfix. Maybe you can even find and [contribute](#contribute-code) a bugfix?

## Issue Handling Process
When an issue is reported, a committer will look at it and either confirm it as a real issue (by giving the "approved" label), close it if it is not an issue, or ask for more details. Approved issues are then either assigned to a committer in GitHub, reported in our internal issue handling system, or left open as "contribution welcome" for easy or not urgent fixes. An issue that is about a real bug is closed as soon as the fix is committed.

## Contribute Code
You are welcome to contribute code to emobility-smart-charging in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you find a security issue, please act responsibly and report it not in the public issue tracker, but directly to us, so we can fix it before it can be exploited:
 * SAP Customers: if the found security issue is not covered by a published security note, please report it by creating a customer message at https://service.sap.com/message.
 * Researchers/non-Customers: please send the related information to secure@sap.com using [PGP for e-mail encryption](http://global.sap.com/pc/security/keyblock.txt).
